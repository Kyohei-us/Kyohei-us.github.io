I have developed a simple API for the sake of learning TypeScript, JWT (Json Web Tokens), Prisma.

The GitHub repo [link](https://github.com/Kyohei-us/myPrismaExpress)

JWT is used to authenticate API requests.
JWT can have expiration time.

Prisma is an ORM that helps deal with accessing DBs.

Additionally, I used Swagger to add documentation for the API.
