I have created a website, KyokuShare, where anyone can just post what they thought about songs they have listened to.
One of the reasons I created this simple website is that I have always wanted a space where I can share my thoughts on songs.
By now, I see many comments on YouTube music videos. But not everyone listens to music on YouTube.
For example, 90% of my time with music is on Spotify, and they don't provide any such feature yet.
This is why I wanted to create this website.
So, if possible, I'm actively considering introducing Spotify API so that it is much, much easier for users to share songs, albums, and playlists and more.

For developers, if you are interested, please refer to the repo link below.
